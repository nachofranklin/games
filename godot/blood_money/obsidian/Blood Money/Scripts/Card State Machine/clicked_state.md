#### What it needs to do

- make the area2d of the card be monitoring so that it can look out for the CardDropArea from the battle scene
- when the mouse moves change the state to the [[dragging_state]]
- do i want to make it so that if i click again then it goes back to base state? Or am i better leaving that for the dragging state to avoid accidental double clicks? (Left it for now)

#### How to do it
