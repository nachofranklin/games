## Bugs



## Backlog

- [ ] do art needed for cardVisuals scene
- [ ] fan the hand in the battle scene
- [ ] need to come up with a way to remember the card order to move it back to that position
- [ ] manaCS doesn't seem to be registering as an area on the card
- [ ] add a short desc and tooltip desc to card resource
- [ ] make the card visuals reflect the card resource
- [ ] need to make it so that you can click and hold and drag/aim and release or click, drag/aim and click again to release
- [ ] so will probably need to introduce some kind of delay so that it doesn't try to do both incorrectly immediately
- [ ] set the card_target_selector gradient to the players primary colour
- [ ] work on updating the card visuals to reflect the card resource
- [ ] then make the cards actually do some damage or add block
