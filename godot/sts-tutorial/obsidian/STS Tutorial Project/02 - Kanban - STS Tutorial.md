## Bugs

- [ ] on map selector the icon stays the size of when it was clicked, not consistent. Keep clicked icons all one size
- [ ] when doing the attack all cards it would be nice if when hovering over the individual enemy it showed how much damage that enemy would take


## Backlog

- [ ] find software to do simple pixel art @{2025-12-27}
- [ ] add more cards
- [ ] add more relics
- [ ] add more enemies
- [ ] would be nice to set tooltip colours to set colours to save writing it out each time
- [ ] add statuses
