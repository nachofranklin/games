What data does a system need to exist? Or what data should a component show?

e.g.
##### A card needs:
- name
- energy cost
- effect type
- effect value
- rarity indicator
- type indicator (att, skill, power, curse)

##### A unit needs:
- health
- energy
- inventory (list)
- modifiers
- block
- statuses
